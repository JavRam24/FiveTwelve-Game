# FiveTwelve Game
 A project that makes a game similar to 2048.  It uses Python, testing methods, and UI design.  Credits go to University of Oregon CIS department for support.
This was a former assignment I was tasked to complete to create the game.

# How to run the game
The game requires that you run game_manager.py in a python ide or enviroment.  There is an additional ReadMe within the project files that explain the mechanics of the game.

# A Quick Overview
The game has a ReadMe that defines the game.  Use the arrow keys to move the tiles and combine them to increase your score.  When there are no more movements available,
the game is over and you can try again!
